{"name":"DPOS Super Lab","tagline":"DPOS Super Lab website","body":"### DPOS Super Lab.\r\nDPOS Super Lab is to join the competition of DPOS mining, because providing good service as a stable DPOS delegate is a challeging work, and could be very interesting and profitable.\r\n\r\nTwo goals:\r\n\r\n1.  Act as one of the 100 delegate mining nodes, and keep stable with high reputation, 100% online.\r\n2.  Testing DPOS network, reseach on all kinds of attack and cheating possibility. Find the flaw of other 99 mining nodes.\r\n\r\nQuote from [DPOS Mining Delegate Requirements](https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=4124.msg51795#msg51795)\r\n> Becoming a delegate requires:\r\n\r\n> 1. Ability to run provided software on a low-latency connection  \r\n> 2. Ability to setup a secure linux environment \r\n> 3. Ability to get 1% of the vote...\r\n>       + unique geographic location\r\n>       + trusted member of the community\r\n>       + 1000 BIPS  (a couple of PTS or AGS) registration fee... (keep out spammers)\r\n\r\n> Remaining a delegate requires:\r\n\r\n>       + low latency, 99.9% uptime\r\n>       + non-discrimination of valid transactions\r\n>       + better reputation than all but the top 99\r\n\r\n> How to earn the best reputation:\r\n\r\n>       + Provide the most additional services for your pay.\r\n\r\n>             - seed node supporting thousands of connections\r\n>             - block explorers\r\n>             - free web wallets\r\n>             - high speed blockchain downloads\r\n\r\n>       + Provide the most proof as to your transparency \r\n>       \r\n\r\n> You get the idea... who ever is willing to provide the most service for their pay will likely win over someone attempting to provide the least service.
